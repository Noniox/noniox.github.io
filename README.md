"Neón Sportivo" Sports Betting Platform
Overview
Neón Sportivo is a project to develop a state-of-the-art, full-stack online sports betting platform, designed and adapted specifically for the Dominican Republic's market and culture. The goal is to create a secure, modern, intuitive, and exciting user experience, allowing fans to bet on their favorite sports.

This repository contains all the source code and documentation for the project, managed by the Project Lead and their team of AI Agents.

Scope of the Full-Stack MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
The current phase of the project focuses on developing a functional and polished MVP, using a simulated balance (play money) system to test the concept and the end-to-end user experience (Front-End + Back-End). We call this the "Phantom MVP" strategy: we build everything except the real-time odds engine, which will be connected in a future phase.

Key MVP Features:
Account System and User Dashboard:

[ ] User registration, login, and logout (Back-End).

[ ] Personal dashboard with a summary of balance and activity.

[ ] Detailed betting history, queried from the database.

Betting System (Full-Stack Simulated):

[ ] Virtual wallet with a play-money balance, managed by the Back-End.

[ ] Interactive Bet Slip that sends bets to the Back-End API.

[ ] Web-based notification system for bet results.

Functional Sports and Markets in the MVP:

[ ] Baseball (MLB/LIDOM): Betting functionality for Winner and Total Runs.

[ ] Formula 1: Betting functionality for Winner, Podium, and Pole Position.

[ ] Basketball (NBA): Betting functionality for Winner and Handicap.

[ ] Soccer: Visual presence to give the feel of a complete platform. Betting functionality will be implemented post-MVP.

Interface and User Experience (UX/UI):

[ ] mobile-first design inspired by bet365.com (3-column layout).

[ ] Dedicated landing pages for each sport.

[ ] Micro-interactions and animations for a fluid experience.

[ ] Informational sections: Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy, and Responsible Gaming.

MVP Architecture and Technologies
Front-End: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (or a Framework like React/Vue.js).

Back-End: Python (Django/Flask) / Node.js (Express) with a RESTful API.

Future Roadmap (Post-MVP)
Once the MVP is validated, the plan is to expand the platform to include:

Integration of a professional betting engine and payment gateways to operate with real money (subject to regulation).

Implementation of Live Betting.

Expansion of the sports offering and complex markets.

Development of a bonus and promotions system.

Creation of native mobile applications (iOS/Android).
